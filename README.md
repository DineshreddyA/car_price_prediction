Predicting car price using pytorch ml model

Here we train a machine learning model that will help us predict car prices with Machine Learning using PyTorch. The dataset Iâ€™m going to use here to predict car prices is tabular data with the prices of different cars regarding the other variables, the dataset has 258 rows and 9 columns, the variable we want to predict is the selling price of the cars.
